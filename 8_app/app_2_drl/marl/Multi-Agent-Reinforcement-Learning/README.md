# Multi-Agent-Reinforcement-Learning
PyTorch implementations of MADDPG, MAPPO (coming)

The implementation of MADDPG is compatible with PyTorch 1.13 and PettingZoo 1.23.1.

I recommend using a virtual environment to install dependencies, as I can't guarantee
that future versions (i.e. torch 2) won't break this implementation.

This code is part of my course on multi agent reinforcement learning, found on the
Neuralnet Academy, which you can find here: https://www.neuralnet.ai/courses
